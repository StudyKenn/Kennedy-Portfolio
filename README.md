How AI Helped me:

- Helped me debug why I was getting errors with when trying to set up my Routes and Dark Mode Toggle.
- Helped me fix small issues like broken image paths.
- Polish the wording of my project descriptions to sound more professional but still in my tone.

I learned that there are a bunch of teeny tine issues that can break the entire code which was giving me a ton of trouble, but using AI helped me notice the small issue. An example being my image paths and how I set up my directory. I think AI was helpful as a coding assistant because using helped me feel less frustrated over the small things and when I really felt confused I had the energy to return to the learning material to refresh my knowledge. I used ChatGPT for all my assistance.
