                <p>
                    Hello! My name is Kennedy and I am a 23 year old web designer originally from Seattle, WA. I found my love for web-design mostly by accident, but since then I have been dedicated to perfecting my craft.
                    I specialize in accesibile, responsive websites and with a layout and design that truly showcase a company's purpose and personality.
